// T1 acquires write lock on x1 and aborts when site 2 fails, releasing that read lock. T2 acquires write lock on x8 and since site 1 is down, it cannot access x1. T2 writes x8 to 88 on all the sites except site 2. In this case, T2 is waiting for site 2 to be able to access x1. Here, site 2 recovers before T2 commits and so command is stored and executed/ write lock is acquired on x1 when site recovers. Only odd variable (non-replicated) gets executed on recovery of site. Thus, x1 has value 40. x8 has value 88 on all sites except site 2. Then T3 acquires the write lock for x1 and over-writes the value of x1. This, shows that as soon as site recovers, we first execute the blocked commands before moving further. Thus, value of x1 is 18 finally.
