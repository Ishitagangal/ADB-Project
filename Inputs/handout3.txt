// This test case changes the handout edge case a little. Here, T1 and T2 will get the read locks as multiple reads are allowed. T3 will not be able to get write lock as there is a read lock by another transaction on that variable. T4 will not be able to get read lock as T3 is waiting for a write lock before.
